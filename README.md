# K&R C Exercises (2nd Edition)

This project is intended as a comprehensive collection of all exercises from K&R's C Programming Language.

Naturally it is currently a work in progress.

I don't guarantee the accuracy of the solutions presented, although I'm aiming for solutions that are as accurate as I can muster given my skill level.

Constructive criticism is welcome, even if it is harsh. I only care that it is useful and correct.

The solutions for most exercises are provided. As far as my tests have shown most solutions are true and correct.    One exception is the squeeze function from Exercise 2-4, which I have noted to fail using inputs involving hyphens.
